# MSE_Group_Project
Modern Search Engines Group Project Summer by Jannik Brandstetter, Julian Borbeck, Nico Martin, Hoang An Nguyen

## Tü-be-fair
Introducing Tü-be-fair, our approach to a search engine, following the lecture of Modern Search Engines of SS24.
Our main goal was a search engine incorporating the user into its decisions and aiming to be as transparent as

## Setup
Our project is deployed via docker so to build it run:
> docker compose build
After building it you can run:
> docker compose up
